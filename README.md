A recreation of the [Sumplete](https://sumplete.com/) puzzle game.

## How to play

Each row and column must be made to add up to the number shown to the right or bottom of the grid.

The numbers in the grid can be deleted or kept. The goal is to delete the correct numbers so that the sum of the remaining numbers in each row and column matches the corresponding sum clue.

By default, every number on the grid is an "unknown" state. Your goal is to identify which numbers to delete and which to keep to ensure that the sum in each column and row matches its target.

To exclude a cell, click or tap on it. It will turn gray, indicating that you want to remove it from the sum.

To include a cell, click or tap on it again. It will turn green, indicating that you know you want to keep it in the sum.

Click or tap one final time to reset to "unknown" state.

You'll need to keep track of the sums of each row and column as you go along to make sure you're on the right track.

Once you have successfully removed the correct numbers, the sum total on the right/bottom will light up.

Once all numbers on the right and bottom of the grid are lit up, youâ€™ll have won the game!
